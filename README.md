# ParkingPal
2023 HackUTA project solution

Inspiration
Many past experiences with finding places to park being difficult led us to try to come up with a solution using our skills and knowledge in the subject
What it does
It uses an array of sensors that detect cars parking and report it to a database which is then used by the app to find the ones that have not been taken yet.
How we built it
Caffeine, lots of dedication, teamwork. We also used our programming skills and hardware skills to come up with this.
Challenges we ran into
There were no internet modules for the arduinos, and we had some limitations with cloud hosting
Accomplishments that we're proud of
despite the lack of hardware components, we managed to solve it by using serial communication to make it to execute python functions so that it could be connected with the API
What we learned
Many IoT implementations, resilience, some of us learned how to interact with databases using an API, and some of us learned about SwiftUI.
What's next for ParkingPal
Real world implementation, connecting through students to universites, to effectively help the whole faculty and student body
