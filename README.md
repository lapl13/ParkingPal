# ParkingPal
2023 HackUTA Project Solution

Inspiration
We've had many experiences with difficulty finding places to park, which led us to devise a solution using our skills and knowledge in the subject.

What It Does
The application uses an array of sensors to detect parked cars and reports it to a database, then displays open spots on the app.

How We Built It
Caffeine, dedication, teamwork combined with our programming skills, hardware familiarity, and desire to bring this application to life.

Challenges We Faced
There were no internet modules for the Arduino, and the lack of experience as a first-timer caused difficulties with cloud hosting. 

Accomplishments 
Despite being novices in many of our implemented technologies, we solved it through effective team communication. For example, we executed Python functions that read the serial output and converted them into API calls.

What we learned
In many IoT implementations resilience, some learned how to interact with databases using an API, and some learned about SwiftUI.

What's next for ParkingPal
Real-world implementation, connecting with universities, to effectively help the whole faculty and student body.
